# Introduction
- Project focused on applying the Data Science process
- CRISP-DM process
- Dataset used is the famous Titanic

# Process
### Application of the CRIPS-DM Model to resolve the problem raised
- Business Understanding
	- The _Business Understanding_ phase focuses on understanding the objectives and requirements of the project.
- Data Understanding
	- Next is the _Data Understanding_ phase. Adding to the foundation of _Business Understanding_, it drives the focus to identify, collect, and analyze the data sets that can help you accomplish the project goals.
- Data Preparation
	- This phase, which is often referred to as “data munging”, prepares the final data set(s) for modeling.
- Modeling
	- Here you’ll likely build and assess various models based on several different modeling techniques.
- Evaluation
	- _Evaluation_ phase looks more broadly at which model best meets the business and what to do next.
- Deployment
	- A model is not particularly useful unless the customer can access its results. The complexity of this phase varies widely.
